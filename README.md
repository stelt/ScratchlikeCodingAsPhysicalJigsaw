# TangibleJigsawCoding
nodeJS bridging to openCV, cam above table looking for valid program of physical jigsaw pieces (Scratch, Snap!, Blockly, TidyBlocks, edublocks.org, etc.)

I'm wondering how this will be experienced, especially by small groups. At least you're not staring into a screen all the time.
